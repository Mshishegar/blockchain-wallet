Dear user

Mr. Ika Motto

We inform you that we followed up your case both through the technical management unit and through the e-commerce judge.

The e-commerce judge has warned the blockchain technical unit that by January 17th, the robot platform and filing will be ready and the binary counting operation will begin, otherwise the judge will issue a decision directly without considering the technical committee.
